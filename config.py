# Config Module: config.py

# This module will store the API keys, base URL for Alpaca API, and other configuration settings.

# Note: In a real-world application, it's recommended to use environment variables or encrypted secrets management
# solutions for storing sensitive information like API keys. This example is for demonstration purposes only.

API_KEY = "CKY3L9YT6JKVTHC4U01Z"
SECRET_KEY = "7qOhe8fsK1AolQOHPA2oz2OcoTe3oGjQ5bswFaa5"
BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"  # Use this URL for paper trading

# Additional configuration settings can be added here as needed, such as model parameters, trading strategy settings,
# and data fetching intervals.

# Remember to replace placeholder API keys with your actual Alpaca API keys and to handle them securely.
