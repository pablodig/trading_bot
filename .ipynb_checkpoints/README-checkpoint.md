# Trading Bot

This project is a trading bot designed to automate trading strategies on various exchanges. It leverages market data to make real-time decisions and execute trades on behalf of the user. Below is an overview of the key components and functionalities:

### Config.py
This module stores API keys, base URL for the Alpaca API, and other configuration settings essential for connecting to the trading platforms.

### Data_manager.py
Responsible for fetching historical and real-time data from financial markets. It uses yfinance for historical data and Alpaca API for real-time data, preprocessing this data to make it suitable for the LSTM model.

### Executor.py
Executes trades based on the signals generated by the trading strategy. It uses the Alpaca API to place buy or sell orders based on the decisions made by the trading bot.

### Main.py
Orchestrates the entire trading process, utilizing other modules for data management, model training, prediction, strategy definition, and trade execution.

### Model.py
Defines the LSTM model using Keras, trains it with stock data, and makes predictions. This module is crucial for analyzing market data and deciding on trade actions.

### Strategy.py
Implements the trading strategy based on the model's predictions and defines when to buy or sell. It uses the predicted price changes to determine the trade actions.
