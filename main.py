    #     execute_trade(symbol, quantity=1, trade_action=action)  # Quantity is set to 1 for simplicity

# Note: This main module is highly simplified and assumes certain steps, such as model training and prediction, are
# already defined. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to integrate data fetching, preprocessing, model training,
# and prediction dynamically based on live or recent data. Additionally, integrating proper error handling, logging,
# and monitoring mechanisms is crucial for a production-ready trading bot.
