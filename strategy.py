# Note: The define_trade_action function is a basic implementation of a trading strategy.
# It should be further refined based on backtesting results and adjusted according to the risk tolerance and
# investment goals of the user. Additionally, it can be expanded to include more sophisticated trading signals
# and criteria for decision-making.
